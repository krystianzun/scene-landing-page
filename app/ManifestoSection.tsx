          We believe the internet needs a straightforward, non-commercial 3D
          viewer—a tool that lets anyone share and view 3D models with ease.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our world is 3D, yet we&apos;re still stuck sharing and viewing
          content on flat, 2D screens. It doesn&apos;t make sense.
        </p>
        <p>
          Current tools for sharing 3D content are either too complicated or too
          limited. Whether you&apos;re a creator showcasing your work or a user
          exploring, the barriers are frustrating. With AI-generated 3D models
          and XR technologies on the rise, the need for easy 3D sharing is only
          growing. But there&apos;s a huge gap—a lack of simple, intuitive tools
          for bringing these creations to life online.
        </p>
        <p>
          We&apos;re here to change that. Our mission is clear: to create a
          platform that makes sharing and viewing 3D models quick and easy. No
          complicated software, no confusing interfaces—just a clean, powerful
          tool anyone can use. We want to make it effortless for creators to
          share their vision and for users to dive into 3D content.
